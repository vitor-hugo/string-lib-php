<!-- MARK: Usage -->

# Usage

You can use this library in two ways, using specific **Traits** or **instantiating the TString** class.

## Via Traits

Traits are a good way to use only the functions you need, just use them within your classes.

> [!NOTE]
> All valitors and manipulators traits functions visibility are `public static`.

```php
use Torugo\TString\Traits\Validators\TStringContains;

class MyClass()
{
    use TStringContains;

    public function myValidation() {
        // ...
        if (self::contains($haystack, $needle, false)) {
            // Do something...
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```


## Via TString object

TString class is the easiest way to use the functions of this library, by using it you will have
access to all features in a single object.

```php
use Torugo\TString\TString;

if  (TString::contains($haystack, $needle, false)) {
    // Do something
}
```
